# Integrative proteogenomic analysis reveals hepatokine-mediated liver-kidney crosstalk in chronic kidney disease
CKD is increasingly recognized as a major complication of metabolic syndrome (MetS), potentially driven by aberrant interactions between the kidney and other bioactive organs. The intricate inter-organ crosstalk in the context of metabolic dysfunction complicates the identification of the primary causal mediators underlying CKD risk. Recent large-scale proteomic studies facilitate the investigation of potential mediators driving kidney dysfunction. Here, we utilize protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) as genetic instruments to evaluate the causal role of plasma proteins on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 1.5 million participants. We identify 38 protein-eGFR associations, 12 of which are previously unreported. Integrative multi-modal analyses of tissue-wide expression profiles and kidney histopathology reveal hepatokines as a key mediator in liver-kidney crosstalk. We decode the molecular mechanisms of hepatokines in regulating kidney function and prioritize cell types and ligandâ€“receptor interactions governing this crosstalk. Finally, we provide multi-layer evidence from human genetics supporting hepatokine ANGPTL3 as a promising therapeutic target for CKD. Our study establishes a novel pathophysiological role for hepatokines with a mechanistic link mediating the liver-kidney communication, offering biological insights into the metabolic regulation of kidney disease.
